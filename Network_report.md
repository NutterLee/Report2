# What is a network?

A computer network or data network is a telecommunications network which allows computers to exchange data.

In computer networks, networked computing devices exchange data with each other using a data link. The connections between nodes are established using either cable media or wireless media.

The best-known computer network is the Internet.

## Technologies
### Wired technologies
* Coaxial cable: widely used for cable television systems, office buildings, and other work-sites for local area networks.
* ITU-T G.hn technology: use existing home wiring (coaxial cable, phone lines and power lines) to create a high-speed (up to 1 Gigabit/s) local area network.
* Twisted pair wire: the most widely used medium for all telecommunication.  
* An optical fiber: a glass fiber. 

### Wireless technologies
* Terrestrial microwave – Terrestrial microwave communication uses Earth-based transmitters and receivers resembling satellite dishes. Terrestrial microwaves are in the low-gigahertz range, which limits all communications to line-of-sight. Relay stations are spaced approximately 48 km (30 mi) apart.
* Communications satellites – Satellites communicate via microwave radio waves, which are not deflected by the Earth's atmosphere. The satellites are stationed in space, typically in geosynchronous orbit 35,400 km (22,000 mi) above the equator. These Earth-orbiting systems are capable of receiving and relaying voice, data, and TV signals.
* Cellular and PCS systems use several radio communications technologies. The systems divide the region covered into multiple geographic areas. Each area has a low-power transmitter or radio relay antenna device to relay calls from one area to the next area.
* Radio and spread spectrum technologies – Wireless local area networks use a high-frequency radio technology similar to digital cellular and a low-frequency radio technology. Wireless LANs use spread spectrum technology to enable communication between multiple devices in a limited area. IEEE 802.11 defines a common flavor of open-standards wireless radio-wave technology known as Wifi.
* Free-space optical communication uses visible or invisible light for communications. In most cases, line-of-sight propagation is used, which limits the physical positioning of communicating devices.

### Exotic technologies

* IP over Avian Carriers was a humorous April fool's Request for Comments, issued as RFC 1149. It was implemented in real life in 2001.
* Extending the Internet to interplanetary dimensions via radio waves, the Interplanetary Internet.

# Key indicators
### Key indicators of network

* Bandwidth
* Throughput
* Jitter
* Bit error rate
* Latency

### How to measure
Network performance measures for a circuit-switched network and one type of packet-switched network, viz. ATM:

* Circuit-switched networks: In circuit switched networks, network performance is synonymous with the grade of service. The number of rejected calls is a measure of how well the network is performing under heavy traffic loads. Other types of performance measures can include the level of noise and echo.
* ATM: In an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network, performance can be measured by line rate, quality of service (QoS), data throughput, connect time, stability, technology, modulation technique and modem enhancements.

There are many ways to measure the performance of a network, as each network is different in nature and design. Performance can also be **modelled** instead of measured. For example, **state transition diagrams** are often used to model queuing performance in a circuit-switched network.

### Scope of network parameters

* Bandwidth: 
 + Common connections range anywhere from 20-100MB/s down, and 5-100MB/s up, with faster being available for businesses.
* Throughput
	+ If the file being transferred must cross an 11 Mbit wireless link, for example, then that would limit the transfers maximum throughput to the actual speed of that wireless link.
* Jitter
	+ Jitter is often measured in Milliseconds. RFC 4689 defines jitter as “the absolute value of the difference between the forwarding delay of two consecutive received packets belonging to the same stream”.

* Bit error rate
	+ Error rate is usually measured over time, and most protocols can tolerate a small amount of error without noticeable function degradation. 
* Latency
	+ The fastest possible connection between two points (and therefore minimum possible latency) is determined by the speed of light, which even at 299,792.458Km/s [or 186,000 Miles/sec] does begin to have noticeable effect over long distances. For example, it takes about 67ms to transmit a packet at the speed of light between NYC and LA, and 2580 Ms (2.58 seconds) between Earth and the Moon.


# My comment 
1. The better your network hardwares are, the better the network you have, whereas sometimes limited by externel environment.
2. Network security calls for more attention.
3. Wired networks performs better than wireless networks in most cases but suffer from inconvience. The choice deponds on users.
